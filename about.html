    <h3>Experience and Aspirations</h2>

    <p>
        <br>Hello again!
        <br>
        <br>
        I am a currently Sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics at Huston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas. Prior to college, I had zero coding experience but I am now proficient
        in JAVA and C++. I have worked as an IT Technician at my University for about a year now and my time working there has allowed me to see a side of Tech that I was not exposed to before.
        I have gained hands-on experience dealing with computer hardware while performing installations, fixing networking issues, restarting servers and tending to the technical difficulties students at
        my University experience daily. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In the future, I hope to do a lot of front-end work with computer software because I want to be able to provide value to others. As a very creative person, I would love my work
        to be seen by anyone who interacts with a brand or project I am associated with. This way, I can interact with my end customers and finally be able to not only create new technology but also 
        improve how technology is used around world. 
        <br>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        <br>
        Travelling is my favorite thing to do! I am a very inquisitive person so traveling helps me explore and provide answers to a lot of the unanswered questions I have about the world.
        As a 19 year old college student, I have not had the oppotunity to do much exploring but I hope to do a lot of that in the future. I am Nigerian and being from a country
        with such beautiful culture makes me value the culture of others as well. I hope to be able to see the beautiful cultures people around the world have.
        <br>
        <br>
        I love to work out; I started going to the gym consistently this year. My friends and family are very important to me so I love to spend time with them. I love to teach people and also learn. 
        I like to keep myself busy so I am always working on a project. Lastly, I love to binge-watch TV shows!
        <br>
