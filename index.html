    <p>
        Hello! Welcome to my website. I am a Sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics at Huston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas. I love to learn new things and travel. In the future, I hope to use my Computer Science degree and all the knowledge I acquire along the way to improve the way technology is used in the world. 
        Currently, my goal is to gain a lot of knowledge in various programming languages because of my passion for Computer Science and Technology.
        Thank you for visiting my website!
